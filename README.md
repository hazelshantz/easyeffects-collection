# easyeffects-collection
A collection of easyeffects presets meant for laptops, but may work with headphones too.

# About

This repository, contains a collection of json config files, meant to be used with easyeffects, to enhance audio on laptop speakers.

On Linux, based on my experience, PipeWire default settings output the RAW audio, making it sound like cheap audio, compared to Windows. the files here aim to fix that. 

This also contains files that can be used when using headphones and regular speakers.

IRS files are also provided, to be used with the convolver.

## How to use:

`git clone` this repo, and place the files on `~/.config/easyeffects` or on `~/.var/app/com.github.wwmm.easyeffects/config/easyeffects/output/` if using the flatpak version.

Then, open EasyEffects, and open the profiles drop down. start testing the profiles and adjust them to your needs.
